# College Life Adventure â€“ COMP 163 Assignment 4

## Overview
This is an interactive text-based game that simulates college life decisions. Players choose a course load, select study strategies, and experience the outcomes on GPA, stress, and social balance. The game demonstrates branching logic through different scenarios and endings.

## Features & Concepts Demonstrated
- **If / Elif / Else statements**: Used in course load planning (Light, Standard, Heavy) with GPA thresholds.
- **Comparison operators (>=, <=, ==, !=)**: To check GPA and apply different outcomes.
- **Logical operators (and, or, not)**: For study strategy decisions (Programming, Math, English, History).
- **Membership operators (in, not in)**: To validate subject choices and handle invalid input.
- **Identity operators (is, is not)**: Used in final semester assessment for type checking.
- **Nested if statements**: Applied in the final assessment to produce multiple unique endings.
